## 🌟 Overview

SG QUANTUM OS is a revolutionary operating system framework that implements the ancient Five Elements theory (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) in modern quantum computing systems. This creates a self-balancing, resilient system that automatically maintains harmony between competing operational concerns.

## 🎯 Five Elements Architecture

| Element | Principle | System Function |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **🌳 WOOD** | Growth & Expansion | Autoscaling & Resource Management |
| **🔥 FIRE** | Transformation | Circuit Breaking & Incident Response |
| **🌍 EARTH** | Stability | Backup, Recovery & Rollback |
| **🔒 METAL** | Structure | Security & Isolation |
| **💧 WATER** | Flow | Rate Control & Adaptation |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from safeway_guardian import ElementalOrchestrator

# Initialize the Quantum OS
quantum_os = ElementalOrchestrator(system_name="MyQuantumSystem")

# Run with elemental harmony
quantum_os.run_quantum_os(duration=3600)  # Run for 1 hour
