## 🌟 Overview  

SG QUANTUM OS is a revolutionary operating system framework that implements the ancient Five Elements theory (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) in modern quantum computing systems. This creates a self-balancing, resilient system that automatically maintains harmony between competing operational concerns.

## 🎯 Five Elements Architecture

| Element | Principle | System Function | Quantum Resonance |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **🌳 WOOD** | Growth & Expansion | Autoscaling & Resource Management | 528 Hz |
| **🔥 FIRE** | Transformation | Circuit Breaking & Incident Response | 741 Hz |
| **🌍 EARTH** | Stability | Backup, Recovery & Rollback | 396 Hz |
| **🔒 METAL** | Structure | Security & Isolation | 417 Hz |
| **💧 WATER** | Flow | Rate Control & Adaptation | 639 Hz |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from safeway_guardian import ElementalOrchestrator

# Initialize the Quantum OS with elemental harmony
quantum_os = ElementalOrchestrator(
    system_name="MyQuantumSystem",
    operator="Nicolas E. Santiago"
)

# Run with elemental balance monitoring
quantum_os.run_quantum_os(duration=3600)  # Run for 1 hour
